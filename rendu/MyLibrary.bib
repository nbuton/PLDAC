The software was released open source and was compatible with {OpenVIBE} [2]. The system is based on {ERP} classification using the oddball paradigm with a grid of 36 possible targets. This second version extends the game to the multiuser scenario. It includes four game modes namely Solo, Collaboration, Cooperation, Competition which are suitable for hyperscanning studies. Thanks to a classification algorithm based on Riemannian geometry, the system shows very good accuracy and is fully " Plug \& Play " , no calibration phase is needed.},

	abstract = {P300 dataset bi2013a from a “Brain Invaders” experiment (2013) carried-out at University of Grenoble Alpes. Simple Python scripts for working with the dataset are available at https://github.com/plcrodrigues/{BrainInvaders}-2013a-Dataset Dataset Description This dataset concerns an experiment carried out at {GIPSA}-lab (University of Grenoble Alpes, {CNRS}, Grenoble-{INP}) in 2013. Principal Investigators: Erwan Vaineau, Dr. Alexandre Barachant Scientific Supervisor :  Dr. Marco Congedo Technical Supervisor : Anton Andreev The experiment uses the Brain Invaders P300-based Brain-Computer Interface [7], which uses the Open-{ViBE} platform for on-line {EEG} data acquisition and processing [1, 9]. For classification purposes the Brain Invaders implements on-line Riemannian {MDM} classifiers [2, 3, 4, 6]. This experiment features both a training-test (classical) mode of operation and a calibration-less mode of operation [4, 5, 6].  The recordings concerned 24 subjects in total. Subjects 1 to 7 participated to eight sessions, run in different days, subject 8 to 24 participated to one session. Each session consisted in two runs, one in a Non-Adaptive (classical) and one in an Adaptive (calibration-less) mode of operation. The order of the runs was randomized for each session. In both runs there was a Training (calibration) phase and an Online phase, always passed in this order. In the non-Adaptive run the data from the Training phase was used for classifying the trials on the Online phase using the training-test version of the {MDM} algorithm [3, 4]. In the Adaptive run, the data from the training phase was not used at all, instead the classifier was initialized with generic class geometric means and continuously adapted to the incoming data using the Riemannian method explained in [4]. Subjects were completely blind to the mode of operation and the two runs appeared to them identical. In the Brain Invaders P300 paradigm, a repetition is composed of 12 flashes, of which 2 include the Target symbol (Target flashes) and 10 do not (non-Target flash). Please see [7] for a description of the paradigm. For this experiment, in the Training phases the number of flashes is fixed (80 Target flashes and 400 non-Target flashes). In the Online phases the number of Target and non-Target still are in a ratio 1/5, however their number is variable because the Brain Invaders works with a fixed number of game levels, however the number of repetitions needed to destroy the target (hence to proceed to the next level) depends on the user’s performance [4, 5]. In any case, since the classes are unbalanced, an appropriate score must be used for quantifying the performance of classification methods (e.g., balanced accuracy, {AUC} methods, etc). This database has been used in the development of the common spatio-temporal pattern method for estimating {ERPs} [8]. Data were acquired with a Nexus ({TMSi}, The Netherlands) {EEG} amplifier: Sampling frequency: 512 samples per second Digital Filter: No Electrodes:  16 wet Silver/Silver Chloride electrodes positioned at {FP}1, {FP}2, F5, {AFz}, F6, T7, Cz, T8, P7, P3, Pz, P4, P8, O1, Oz, O2 according to the 10/20 international system Reference: left ear-lobe Ground: N/A The data for Subject X is available as a {subjectX}.zip file.
